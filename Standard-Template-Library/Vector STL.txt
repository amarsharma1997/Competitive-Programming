Vector:- 

Vector is a list of elements which has a dynamic size unlike array but it has contiguous memory allocation
Same as array. 

Declaring a vector:-    vector< data type(user defined or fundamental) > v;

Accessing vector elements:- since it has contiguous memory allocation it can be accessed as v[i] which represents
i+1th element of the vector..

Some functions associated with vector:-

1) v.size() -returns size of vector.
2) v.push_back(x) - pushes x at the end of the vector.
3) v.pop_back() - pops the last element of the vector.
4) v.back()  - returns last element of the vector.
5) v.begin() -address of the first element of the vector.
6) v.end() - returns address where the vector ends (if the last address is x then it will return x+ sizeof(element)).
